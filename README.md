{0.0.1} When this program opens, it will open a window with 10 buttons in a diagonal line. When you click them, they show the ore. if you want to fork my app, please in your README, put in @IEYT.

{Alpha-0.0.2 test} Same as the last release, except for the change from the TK logo to a Minecraft logo but please check the Beta-Code folder and go into the (2nd)Beta-Code folder, then check out the Info.md then before installing. As always, i'll appreciate when you fork my app, in your README, put @IEYT.

{0.0.2} Finally i've found a way to incorporate a logo the into an EXE(Rare.exe). Once you install the .exe, it will extract into two files. the files are Logo.ico and Rarest-Minecraft-Ores.exe(Open the .exe). As always, i'll appreciate when you fork my app, in you README, put @IEYT.

{0.0.3} When this program opens, it will open a window with 10 buttons in a zig-zag line. The 0.0.3 update includes every feature from previous updates, and the new feature for this update is added color to the background, buttons, and text.
