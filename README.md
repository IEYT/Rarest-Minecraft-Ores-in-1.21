# Rarest Minecraft Ores in 1.21
{0.0.1} When this program opens, it will open a window with 10 buttons in a diagonal line. When you click them, they show the ore. if you want to fork my app, please in your README, put in @IEYT.

{Alpha-0.0.2 test} Same as the last release, except for the change from the TK logo to a Minecraft logo but please check the Beta-Code folder and go into the (2nd)Beta-Code folder, then check out the Info.md then before installing. As always, i'll appreciate when you fork my app, in your README, put @IEYT.

{0.0.2} Finally i've found a way to incorporate a logo the into an EXE(Rare.exe). Once you install the .exe, it will extract into two files. the files are Logo.ico and Rarest-Minecraft-Ores.exe(Open the .exe). As always, i'll appreciate when you fork my app, in you README, put @IEYT.

{0.0.3} When this program opens, it will open a window with 10 buttons in a zig-zag line. The 0.0.3 update includes every feature from previous updates, and the new feature for this update is added color to the background, buttons, and text. As always, i'll appreciate when you fork my app, in you README, put @IEYT.

This is a tool for removing www. and https://www. in dictionary's. It was created partially by the tabnine ai and Me. Note that it creates a new dictionary and the original one is unchanged.

<h4>Example of how it works</h4>

```python
from RWs import remove_www_fKey, remove_www_fVal, remove_www

example_dict = {
    "www.example": "https://www.example.com"
}

example_dict_2 = remove_www_fKey(example_dict)
print(example_dict_2)

example_dict_cop = remove_www_fVal(example_dict)
print(example_dict_cop)

example_dict_co = remove_www(example_dict)
print(example_dict_co)
```
<h4>Result</h4>

```py
{'example': 'https://www.example.com'}
{'www.example': 'example.com'}
{'example': 'example.com'}
```
