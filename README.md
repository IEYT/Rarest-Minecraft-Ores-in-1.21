# Rarest Minecraft Ores in 1.21
{0.0.1} When this program opens, it will open a window with 10 buttons in a diagonal line. When you click them, they show the ore. if you want to fork my app, please in your README, put in @IEYT.

{Alpha-0.0.2 test} Same as the last release, except for the change from the TK logo to a Minecraft logo but please check out the Beta-Code folder before installing. As always, please in your README, put in @IEYT.

{0.0.2} Finally i've found a way to incorporate a logo the into an EXE(Rare.exe). Once you install the EXE, it will extract into two files. the files are Logo.ico and Rarest-Minecraft-Ores.exe(Open the .exe). As always, i'll appreciate when you fork my app, in you README, put @IEYT.

{0.0.3} The 0.0.3 update includes every feature from previous updates, and the new feature for this update is added color for background, buttons, and text. As always, i'll appreciate when you fork my app, in you README, put @IEYT.
