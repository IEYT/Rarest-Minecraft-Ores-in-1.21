You can't run the Alpha 0.0.2 test with VS Code terminal, I don't know why but to run this code, you must use this code on Powershell
cd (the drive your files are on ex. C:/(the folder where you store the file), then on Powershell, use this command, python Rarest-Mincraft-Ores-Alpha_Test. Then the app will open. Thank you for your time!

P.S: VS Code problem, I am 99% sure, because with the latest update, it works.
